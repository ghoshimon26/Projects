The dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of
2020, and keeps getting updated.

The dataset is collected from Kaggle, which in turn is primarily
based on the data collected from the website flixable.com that allows
users to browse all the TV Shows and Movies currently available to
stream on Netflix.

Data includes information on the title's name, type (show or movie),
director, cast, countries involved in the production, date of
availability on Netflix, original release year, rating(TV-MA or TV
Parental Guidelines), duration, and genre.

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the following:

1.Is Netflix increasingly focusing on TV Shows rather than movies in recent
years?

2.Is there more mature or kids-friendly content?

3.Which directorsâ€™ movies do we see more often on Netflix?

4.What has been the content growth of movies year-wise?

5.What has been the content growth of tv shows year-wise?

6.In which months does Netflix add more contents?

7.Which countries are producing more content?

8.Which countries have a higher average length of movies?

9.Do most Netflix TV Shows have a longer life span?
